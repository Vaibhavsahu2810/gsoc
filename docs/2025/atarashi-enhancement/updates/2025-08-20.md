# Week 12

*(August 14, 2025 - August 20, 2025)*

## Overview

This week was dedicated to **optimizing Atarashi’s performance**, particularly addressing the **database transaction bottlenecks** identified earlier. The improvements led to significant efficiency gains during execution.

---

## Development Progress

* Implemented **bulk insertion of license results** into the database. DB transactions could be 
improved by doing bulk insertion into the database using query aggregation. Previously, it was one 
trasaction for one row in the license table, but now, the agent first scans and identifies multiple 
rows that need to be inserted and then does a bulk insertion step to insert them in a single 
transaction. This saves valuable time during DB trasactions.

* Added **license caching** inside DB tables.  
  * Before inserting, the agent now checks if the license entry already exists.  
  * If yes → skip insertion.  
  * Prevents duplicate writes and improves efficiency.  

* Noted that algorithmic complexity (second issue from Week 11) still needs further research (e.g., LSH), but DB-level optimizations already provide noticeable improvements.
