# Week 11

*(August 07, 2025 - August 13, 2025)*

## Overview

This week focused on completing the **UI integration of Atarashi** within FOSSology and refining its configuration workflow. The agent is now being **triggered seamlessly from the UI using the scheduler**, ensuring that users can run Atarashi directly from the FOSSology interface.

---

## Development Progress

* Completed the **Atarashi UI integration** with FOSSology.
* Finalized the **configuration setup** in `atarashi.conf`.
* Verified that the agent can be triggered **end-to-end from the UI via scheduler**.
* Conducted extensive testing on different file types.
* Identified **two performance bottlenecks**:
  1. **Database transactions** were expensive and slowed down processing.  
  2. The **algorithms themselves are inherently computationally heavy**, requiring exploration of faster alternatives such as **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**.

## Meeting

* Reviewed testing results with mentors.  
* Discussed **short-term optimizations** (DB-level improvements) vs. **long-term solutions** (rethinking algorithmic complexity).  
* Consensus: address DB transaction overhead first, while keeping algorithmic improvements as a future direction.

---

## Status

* UI integration completed.  
* Agent fully schedulable and triggerable from FOSSology UI.  
* Performance issues identified and documented.  

---

## Next Steps

* Optimize **DB transactions** via bulk operations.  
* Introduce caching to reduce redundant writes.  
* Investigate feasibility of **LSH-based optimizations** for longer-term improvements.
