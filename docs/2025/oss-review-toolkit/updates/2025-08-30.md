# Week 11 Activities

## Integration of ORT with FOSSology Sync Meeting 11

*(August 25, 2025 – August 31, 2025)*

### PR Feedback and Changes

This week revolved around feedback on my **Docker integration PR [#10764](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/10764)**. Initially, I had opened the PR to add the **FOSSology Nomos binary** into the ORT Docker build so that the scanner could be used out of the box.  

After review, @sschuberth suggested that the Docker commit should instead be included as part of the **scanner implementation PR [PR #10631](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/10631)**, because the binary is a prerequisite for running Nomos. This way, the Docker setup, scanner integration, and functional test would land together in a single PR.

Based on this feedback, I decided to **close PR [#10764](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/10764)** and migrate the Docker changes directly into PR [PR #10631](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/10631).  

### Documentation Progress

In addition to coding work, I also **completed writing my GSoC final documentation report** this week. It brings together the project’s goals, design decisions, implementation details, and future ideas.  
The full documentation is available here: [GSoC-2025 Repository](https://github.com/Prakash-Mishra-9ghz/GSoC-2025).

### Progress

- Opened PR [#10764](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/10764) for adding the Nomos binary to Docker.  
- Received review suggesting to combine it with the scanner implementation.  
- Closed PR [#10764](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/10764) and moved changes into [PR #10631](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/10631).  
- Started preparing a functional test alongside the scanner integration.  
- Finished writing the **GSoC final documentation report** ([GSoC-2025 Repo](https://github.com/Prakash-Mishra-9ghz/GSoC-2025)).  

### Next Steps

- Finalize the functional test to validate the Nomos scanner inside Docker.  
- Work on ensuring both Docker + scanner integration are reviewed and merged together.  
- Share the completed GSoC documentation more widely.
