# Week 10 Activities

## Integration of ORT with FOSSology Sync Meeting 10

*(August 18, 2025 – August 24, 2025)*

### Final Documentation Work

This week, I started drafting my **final GSoC documentation report**. I sketched out sections covering the project’s goals, design decisions, implementation details, challenges, and ideas for the future. It felt good to see the entire journey coming together in one place.

### Draft PR: Dockerfile Integration

I also opened a **draft Pull Request** to integrate the Nomos binary into the ORT Docker image. This PR will allow the Nomos scanner to be used straight out of the box when running ORT inside Docker — no extra setup required. I labeled it as a draft, anticipating that the core scanner plugin (PR #10631) needs to be merged first.

 here's what I wrote in the PR:

> "I have added the Nomos binary from FOSSology to the ORT Docker build. This will allow the new FOSSology-nomos scanner to be used directly inside the Docker image without extra setup.  
> I am opening this as a draft because the scanner integration itself is still under review in PR [#10631](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/10631).

### Progress

- Started writing the final documentation with an outlined structure.  
- Created a draft PR for Dockerfile integration that includes the Nomos binary in the ORT Docker image.  
- Ensured everything is in place for smooth review once the scanner plugin lands.


### Next Steps

- Continue fleshing out the final report with content and visuals.  
- Address feedback on the Dockerfile draft PR once initial reviews come in.  
- Prepare everything for the project's final wrap-up and merge-ready state.
