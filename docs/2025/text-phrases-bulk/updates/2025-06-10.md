# Week 2

_(June 10, 2025 - June 16, 2025)_

## Meeting 1

Meeting for this week didn't happen because I was busy with my end semester examinations

## Progress

Didn't make much progress this week because of my end semester examinations, but still got some work done this week.

- Created a new page under Admin --> Text Management to allow the user to perform CRUD operations for the custom text phrases he want to add.
- For this, I created a new table called custom_phrase table and made the creation of this table with the existing build process of FOSSology.
- Tested everything with both docker build process and bare metal installation setup of FOSSology.

### Implementation of the new page

I divided the implementation of the new page into 4 steps.

- Database Foundation
- Backend Logic
- User Interface
- Comprehensive Test Coverage

## Feature Architecture

The implementation follows FOSSology's plugin architecture and MVC pattern:

```
├── Database Layer (PostgreSQL)
│   ├── custom_phrase table
│   └── Migration scripts
├── Backend Layer (PHP)
│   ├── AdminCustomTextManagement controller
│   └── Database operations
├── Frontend Layer (Twig Templates + JavaScript)
│   ├── Management interface
│   ├── Edit/Add forms
│   └── Ajax interactions
└── Testing Layer
    └── Unit tests for functionality
```

### Key Features Implemented

- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete custom text phrases
- **License Association**: Link custom text to specific licenses in the system
- **User Tracking**: Track who created and manages each custom text entry
- **Status Management**: Active/inactive toggle for text entries
- **Ajax-powered Interface**: Responsive UI with real-time updates
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- **DataTables Integration**: Professional table interface with sorting, pagination, and search

## Implementation Steps

#### 1st Step taken: Database Foundation

- **Database Migration**: Created migration from version 4.3.0 to 4.4.0
- **Table Structure**: Implemented `custom_phrase` table with complete schema
- **Performance Optimization**: Added strategic indexes
- **Permissions Setup**: Configured proper database permissions

#### 2nd Step taken: Backend Logic

- **Controller Implementation**: Full CRUD operations
- **Security Integration**: Admin permission checks
- **Ajax Endpoints**: Real-time data operations
- **Form Validation**: Input validation and error handling

#### 3rd Step taken: User Interface

- **Management Interface**: Professional DataTables-based listing
- **Form Interface**: User-friendly add/edit forms
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Ajax Integration**: Seamless user experience

#### 4th Step taken: Comprehensive Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Access Testing**: Admin privilege verification
- **Form Testing**: UI element validation
- **Smoke Testing**: Basic functionality verification

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The `custom_phrase` table was designed with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE custom_phrase (
  cp_pk SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,              -- Auto-incrementing primary key
  rf_fk INTEGER REFERENCES license_ref(rf_pk), -- Foreign key to license
  user_fk INTEGER,                       -- User who created the entry
  group_fk INTEGER,                      -- Group association
  text TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- Main custom text content
  acknowledgement TEXT,                  -- Acknowledgement text
  comments TEXT,                         -- Additional comments
  created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Creation timestamp
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE         -- Active/inactive status
);
```

**Key Design Features:**

- Foreign key relationship to `license_ref` for data integrity
- Audit trail with user tracking and timestamps
- Soft delete mechanism using `is_active` flag
- Performance indexes on commonly queried fields

### Backend Controller Features

The `AdminCustomTextManagement` controller implements:

**Core Functionality:**

- Full CRUD operations with proper validation
- Admin-only access with authentication checks
- Ajax endpoints for real-time operations
- POST-redirect-GET pattern to prevent duplicate submissions

**Security Implementation:**

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection using proper output escaping
- CSRF protection and admin access control

**Ajax Endpoints:**

```php
GET ?action=get_phrases    // Data retrieval for DataTables
POST ?action=delete        // Phrase deletion
POST ?action=toggle        // Status toggle
```

### Frontend User Interface

**Management Interface Features:**

- Professional DataTables-based listing with sorting and pagination
- Ajax-powered data loading for better performance
- Real-time operations (delete/status toggle) without page refresh
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

**Form Interface Features:**

- User-friendly add/edit forms with proper validation
- Context-aware submit buttons (Save/Update)
- License dropdown integration
- Text truncation for better readability in table view

**User Experience Enhancements:**

- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Loading states and visual feedback
- Full internationalization support
- Scrollable content for overflow handling

```javascript
// Key functionality implementation
function createBrowseTable() {
  tableColumns = [
    { sTitle: "Edit", sClass: "center", bSearchable: false },
    { sTitle: "Text", sClass: "left", bSearchable: true },
    // ... more columns
  ];
}

function deletePhrase(phraseId) {
  /* Ajax deletion with confirmation */
}
function togglePhraseStatus(phraseId, currentStatus) {
  /* Status toggle via Ajax */
}
```

### Testing Implementation

**Test Coverage Areas:**

- Admin access control verification
- Page navigation and element presence
- Form functionality and field rendering
- Basic smoke testing for core features

**Test Methods Implemented:**

```php
function testAdminCustomTextManagementAccess() {
  // Verify admin can access the management page
  // Check for proper page elements and navigation
}

function testAddCustomText() {
  // Test form accessibility and field rendering
  // Ensure validation elements are present
}
```

**Testing Framework:**

- Built on FOSSology's `fossologyTestCase` extension
- Browser automation for UI testing
- Custom assertion methods for validation

## Week Summary

### What was accomplished:

- **Full-Stack Feature**: Complete implementation from database to user interface
- **Security Focus**: Comprehensive security measures including input validation, XSS protection, and admin access control
- **Professional UI**: DataTables integration with Ajax-powered interface
- **Test Coverage**: Basic smoke tests for critical functionality
- **Performance**: Strategic database indexing and efficient query design

### Technical Highlights:

- Database migration system integration
- POST-redirect-GET pattern for form security
- Real-time Ajax operations without page refresh
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly interface
- Proper error handling and validation throughout

### Security Implementation:

```php
// Input validation example
$text = trim($request->get('text', ''));
if (empty($text)) {
    return "ERROR: Text field is required";
}

// XSS protection
htmlentities($row['text'])
```
