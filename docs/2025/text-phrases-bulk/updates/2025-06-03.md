# Week 1

## Meeting 1

Meeting for this week didn't take place 

## Progress

- I connect with my assigned mentors and gained more clarity about FOSSology's codebase architecture.
- I created some wireframes of how the text management page should look like where the user will be able to perform CRUD operations on the custom text phrases.
