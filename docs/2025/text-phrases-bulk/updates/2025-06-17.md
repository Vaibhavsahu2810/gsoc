# Week 3

_(June 17, 2025 – June 23, 2025)_

## Meeting 1

**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Attendees:**

- [Harshit Gandhi](https://github.com/harshitg927)
- [Kaushlendra](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
- [Sushant](https://github.com/its-sushant)
- [Soham](https://github.com/soham4abc)

### Summary:

- Presented the ongoing development of a new page under **Admin → Text Management**, designed to let users manage custom text phrases associated with existing license texts from the `license_ref` table. This functionality involves a newly created `custom_phrase` table.
- Discussed where and how the option to activate the new agent should be made available to users.
- Mentors brought attention to a pull request submitted by a new contributor related to my project.
- We discussed strategies for integrating the contributor’s work into the project.
- Soham recommended that I thoroughly review the PR and document any issues or suggestions related to the submitted code.

## Progress:

- Engaged with mentors to discuss the pull request submitted for my project and shared detailed concerns regarding areas where the implementation was lacking.
- Attempted to fix the issues within the pull request but encountered challenges in successfully resolving them.
- Conducted a thorough review of the submitted code to evaluate which parts could be reused or adapted for the project moving forward.

### Issues I found in the Pull Request by Aditya

- Incorrect plugin registeration
	- File: plugin.php
	- Using register method on $textPhrasePlugin which does not exist
	- Solution: Use global register_plugin() function.
- Missing required class imports
	- TextPhrasePlugin.php
	- Missing imports include: 
		- use Fossolohg/Lib/Auth/Auth
		- use Symfony/component/HttpFoundation/Request
	- Solution: Make the necessary imports
- Missing template file
	- edit.html.twig
	- Solution: create the template file
- Incorrect Method Parameter Handling
	- TextPhrasePlugin.php
	- handle() method use old-style parameter handling
	- Issue: handle() method should accept Request $request
- The to be created text_phrases table has to be manually create by the user. But, this should be integreated with the existing FOSSology build process
- Inconsistent Container Access
	- File: TextPhrasePlugin.php
	- Problem: uneccessary use of $GLOBALS["container"]
	- Solution: should use $this->getObject method which is already present in DefaultPlugin.php
- Missing template in CMakeList.txt
    - missing upload_options.html.twig and edit.html.twig template in CMakeList.txt
- Missing AGENT_REV constant definition
    - Files: textphrase_agent.php, TextPhraseDecider.php
    - Both files use AGENT_REV constant but it's not defined anywhere in the textphrase module
    - Solution: Create a version.php file with define("AGENT_REV", "c1d32f"); similar to other agents
- Missing Auth class import
    - File: TextPhraseDecider.php
    - uses Auth::getUserId() but no import statement for Auth class
    - Solution: Add use Fossology\Lib\Auth\Auth; at the top of the file
- Inconsistent Container Access in Agent Classes
    - Files: textphrase_agent.php, TextPhraseDecider.php
    - Problem: Direct usage of $GLOBALS['container'] to access services
    - Solution: Should use dependency injection or getter methods from base Agent class
- Non-existent insertDecision method
    - File: TextPhraseDecider.php
    - Line 125 calls $this->licenseDao->insertDecision($decision) but this method doesn't exist in LicenseDao
    - Solution: Use proper clearing decision API or implement the missing method
- Missing processUploadId method implementation
    - File: textphrase_agent.php
    - Method processUploadId() exists but should be called by parent Agent class through proper job scheduling
    - Issue: The method is implemented but not integrated with FOSSology's agent scheduling system
- Missing agent registration in CMakeLists.txt
    - File: CMakeLists.txt
    - Missing proper agent registration for scheduler integration
    - Solution: Add proper agent registration commands for FOSSology build system

After this detailed review of the pull request, I concluded that it would be better to continue the work I have already done on my end.
