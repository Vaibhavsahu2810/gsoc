## Engagements
This week i majorly focused of documentation. I wrote documentation for;
- My GSoC final evaluation submission.
- The documentation for the project, what we have accomplished so far, and what still need to be included.

I also took my time make some modification to the current `pipeline.yml` like the precision metric that wasn't properly being exported and displayed in PRs previously created

## Meeting Discussion:

Had a meeting with my mentor, and we majorly discuss the things that needed to be included in my evaluation documentation and requirements needed in the project documentation too.

I was also given a link to two repositories which i can use as a guide for my evaluation documentation.
