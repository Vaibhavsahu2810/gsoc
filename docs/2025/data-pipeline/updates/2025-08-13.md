# WEEK 11
*(August 13, 2025)*

## Attendees:
- [Ayush Kumar Bhardwaj](https://github.com/hastagAB)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)


## Engagements

This week we integrated automation of raising a PR from the retraining pipeline. In this feature, we implemented the PR functionality into the pipeline with;
- Extraction of retraining model metrics from workflow
- Creating a new branch for each retraining triggered, and saved with timestamp
- Automated PR raising using GitHub bot
- Integrated metrics as PR description

I also fix the existing preprocessing and decluttering process to maintain DataFrame alignment while pipeline is running;

- Updated preprocess_data and declutter_data to return Series with original index
- Ensured copyright column is updated in-place without breaking row alignment
- Resolved the length mismatch errors during pipeline execution

## Meeting Discussion:
* This week, I discussed with my mentors on what i have done so far regarding creation of a new PR through a different branch.
* I was able to present and show them the PR that were raised from what when we tested the functionalities

## Subsequent Steps
I will be continuing with solving some errors like the precision that wasn't showing in the metrics of the PR raised, among others.
