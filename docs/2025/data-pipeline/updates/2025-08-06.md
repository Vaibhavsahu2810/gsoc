# WEEK 10
*(August 06, 2025)*

## Attendees:
- [Ayush Kumar Bhardwaj](https://github.com/hastagAB)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)

### Engagements
* I began this week by introducing the testing process to the pipline.
* A lot of challenges were faced, which are;
  - Permission error to save in the model main path in the current working director

  - If we try saving our model in a new path, we will encounter error regarding no available entity_recognizer or declutter_model path in the directory.

* To successfully integrate the testing process in the pipeline, i introduced the entity_recognizer folder and declutter_model folder into the directory we saved our model during training.
* This adjustment will allow us to test the model we saved in the new path from training
* With this, we will be able to test and visualized our testing metrics anything the pipeline runs. This will enable us to make decision in the future on the next steps of any newly trained model coming from the pipeline with respect to the metrics

## Meeting Discussion:
* This week, I discussed with my mentors on what i have done so far regarding the integration of testing to the pipeline.
* I was able to present them with the testing and metrics visualization through the GitHub action branch in my repo.
* A decision was also made regarding how the newly trained model from the pipeline can be uploaded as an artifact, automatically create a new repository branch and raised as a new pull request from the pipeline.

## Subsequent Steps
* I will proceed to working on the next task by implementing the automation of raising a new pull request from the pipeline.
