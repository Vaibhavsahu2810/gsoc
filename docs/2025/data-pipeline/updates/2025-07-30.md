# WEEK 9
*(July 30, 2025)*

## Attendees:
- [Ayush Kumar Bhardwaj](https://github.com/hastagAB)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)

### Engagements
* Lastly I was tasked told to introduce a pickle file into our pipeline system using the available data in the current safaa repository. 
* This week I started by rewriting how some things like dependency installation are injected into our pipeline
* Below are the summary of things i re-wrote for our pipeline;
  - Declared global variable path for static path in the repo
  - Splitted all pipeline steps into different independent steps for better tracking of processes
  - Introduced the use of arguments to run each steps in the pipeline sequentially.
  - Removed `requirements.txt` file and introduced direct dependency installation in the pipeline script

* To introduce a pickle file into the pipeline, i introduced a training step into pipeline, by integrating the existing safaa agent training related script.
* Also, this week I created a new branch named `testing-train` on my own end to test out changes we have made so far, and monitor/simulate how the training will run in the pipeline.
  - I introduced a new argument named "--train" in the retraining steps for the training process.
  - Routed our model to be saved into a new path so we can visualize pickle file if the training was successful and avoid different permissions error.

* The image below shows our completed training process

## Meeting Discussion:
* This week, I had discussion with my mentors on what I have done so far regarding training and modifications I made.
* We also had hands on session with update on our sql to ignore contents ignored on the server when fetching copyright content.
* And lastly i was also told to introduce testing of our trained model in the pipeline

## Subsequent Steps
* I will proceed to implementing the testing phase in the pipeline.
