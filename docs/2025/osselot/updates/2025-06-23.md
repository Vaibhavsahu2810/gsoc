## Attendees

- [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)

- [Oliver Fendt](https://github.com/OliverFendt)

## Discussions

- Reviewed this week’s progress and shared my updates.
- Jan relayed feedback from the Osselot contributors on my reuse changes:
  1. Add an “ℹ️” tooltip explaining the **Enable Osselot export** button’s function.
  2. Toggling **Enable Osselot export** should automatically enable the **SPDX license comments** checkbox.
  3. Explore support for importing multiple reports from Osselot in one operation.
- Demonstrated the Osselot-reuse functionality to Oliver Fendt—received positive feedback.

## Updates

- Migrated version-lookup from GitHub to the Osselot REST API for greater reliability and reduced external dependencies.
- Continued using the GitHub API to fetch and persist SPDX reports.
- Installed Fossology in a dual-boot environment as i got permission issues in my mac instance while using Report Import agent.
- Jan is presenting my PRs to the Osselot maintainers; I’m on standby to incorporate their input.
- Looked into Python’s `multiprocessing` module to plan future parallelization within the Scancode agent.

## Plan for Next Week

1. Implement the Report Import agent enhancements to support Osselot-based reuse.
2. Apply the contributor feedback: add tooltip, auto-enable license comments, and investigate batch imports.
3. Learn more about how i can add multithreading in the Scancode agent to improve scan throughput.
